# UniClaim — Bootstrap Layout (Lab 2.7)
Responsive Bootstrap 5 layouts for **Homepage**, **Registration**, **Login**, and **Forgot Password**, based on the UniClaim (Lost & Found) FRD.

UniClaim is a school-based Lost & Found tracker that streamlines reporting, verification, matching, and return of items. Registered users submit Lost/Found posts with details and photos; admins approve to keep the feed clean, use a match dialog to link related posts, notify owners/finders, track custody, and mark items Pending → Approved → Matched → Resolved. Guests can browse a read-only feed. The app includes role-aware pages—Dashboard, Reports, Items in Custody, Notifications, and Profile/Settings—and is built with a responsive, accessible Bootstrap UI to move cases from “lost” to “returned” fast.
